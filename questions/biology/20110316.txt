- Most animals have body cavities
- All organ systems are interdependent
- Most animals have 11 major organ systems:
  - digestive
  - circulatory
    - open vs closed
  - respiratory
    - not all animals have internal respiratory systems (e.g. lungs, etc.) but
      all have some way to exchange gases
  - immune and lymphatic
    - two components: one at birth, one that we acquire over our lifetimes
  - excretory
  - endocrine
  - reproductive
  - nervous
  - skeletal and integumentary
    - endo vs exoskeleton
    - integumentary - hair
      - hair is a shaft surrounded by epithelial cells
      - nails also contain layers of dead cells
  - muscular
  - ...
- Bioenergetic principals - regulate organism activity
  - bioenergetics - flow of energy through an animal
  - animals are all heterotrophic - fuel in / energy out
  - rate of metabolism is variable - based on:
    - size
      - evidence is clear; explanation is unclear (we don't understand why
        there is an inverse relationship between size and metabolic rate per
        unit mass)
    - actvity levels
    - homeostasis strategy
    - thermoregulation strategy
- Homeostasis
  - most control systems rely on _negative_ feedback loops
    - (positive feedback loops do not turn themselves off)
  - dynamic
    - all feedback loops constantly montiroed and levels are fluctuating
      within a fairly narrow range
    - not all animals maintaine stable internal conditions / regulate every
      component of their internal conditions (because this takes energy)
      - regulators - expend metabolic energy to maintain stability
      - conformers - internal values vary with external conditions
      - some animals regulate some conditions and conform to others
- Thermoregulation
  - all biochemical processes are sensitive to temperature
    - high temp can denature enzymes (change their shape so they no longer
      function properly)
    - extreme temperatures can also alter membrane behavior
  - ectothermic animals gain heat from the surrounding environment
    - most invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, reptipes
  - endothermic animals - use energy to maintain a constant body temperature
    - primarily mammals and birds
    - most endotherms are terrestrial
      - moving on land requires more energy than moving in water
      - land temp fluctuates more than water temp
      - few aquatic animals are endothermic
- dirnation - active at night / dormantu during the day
- estivation - opposite of hibernation
  - desert environments
EC: if an animal is in the dormant condition and it is completely disturbed /
woken up, how easy is it to go back into hibernation and what is the long-term
outcome?
