- Strategies to regulate body temperature:
  - insulation
  - adjusting rate of heat exchange w/ environment
    - constriction or dilation of surface blood vessels
    - fluffing - warms
    - fat
    - countercurrent exchange
      - arterial blood is warmer (comes from body core); warms adjacent venous
        blood in extremeties
      - some ectotherm fishes maintain higher temps in their deep swimming
        muscles with a heat exchanging pattern of blood flow
- insulation
- adjusting rate of heat exchange w/ environment
- evaporative cooling
- behavior
- adjusting metabolic rate
  - evaporative cooling
    - sweating, panting (e.g. dogs), licking, spraying
  - behavior
    - moving into shade/sun
    - moving into/out of water
    - restricting activity to night/day
    - regulating body posture to manage solar exposure
    - migrating
      - whooping cranes
      - even some ectothermic animals migrate (e.g. butterflies)
    - social behavior to share heat
  - adjusting metabolic rate
    - shivering, active motion
    - acclimation - altering lipids to keep membranes fluid
    - torpor (e.g. hibernation)
      - likely triggered by day length

EC: were dinosaurs endotherms or ectotherms
  - how would we know this?  (no living dinosaurs)
  - fins were used for mating (attraction); were they also used for warming?
EC: do bats ever sleep?
  - also, what is the difference b/t sleep and torpor?

== Lecture #9 - Animal nutrition and digestion ==

- Key concepts:
  - animals are heterotriphic
  - nutritional needs - what animals get from food
  - food processing
  - human digestive system

- Animals are always consumers
  - cannot do photosynthesis (and tehrefore cannot convert solar energy to
    usable chemical energy)
  - plants store chemical energy
  - animals eat plants (or other animals)
  - no animals are autotrophic
  - Q: why did my parents tell me that I need to spend time in the sum?
  - Q: metabolic significance of melatonin

- what animals get from food:
  - energy
    - animals generate ATP by aerobic respiration
    - main substrate is carbohydrates
      - fats are also used
      - proteins are used as a last restort
    - digestion converts consumed polymers to the monomers used in respiration
  - essential vitamins and minerals
    - molecules that animals cannot make at all
    - essential aminso acids - used to make proteins
      - most animals can only syntehsize about half of the amino acids that
        they need; remaining amino acids must be consumed
      - all animal proteins are complete (contain all the essential amino
        acids)
      - all plant proteins are incomplete (missing some of the essential amino
        acids)
      - vegetarians must eat a variety of plants so they can get all the amino
        acids that they need (e.g. grains and legumes)
  - carbon skeletons - animals cannot take COâ‚‚ from the atmosphere, so they
    must take carbon from their food
    - animals need organic carbon scaffolds to build our own organic molecules
      (e.g. carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids)

- remember bioenergetics
  - managing the energy budget is essential to maintaining animal function
  - ATP powers:
    - basal metabolism, other activities
    - maintain homeostasis
