- Wind pollination:
  - ~25% of all angiosperms
  - lots of pollen
  - reduced sterile structures
  - _exserted_ (sic) reproductive structures
  - feathery and/or sticky stigma surfaces

- toothache grass
  - stamens on the bottom help to limit self-fertilization

- animal vectors for pollination
  - ~75% of all angiosperms
  - pollinators are insects, but also birds, bats and other small mammals

- brachs (sp?) - modified leaves whose color (influorescence?) attracts
  pollinators

- asters (sp?) - tiny flowers but in massive numbers
  - sunflower
  - each "petal" is actually a flower
  - the center is a cluster of flowers
  - second largest plant family

- orchids
  - produce highly specialized flowers
  - male orchid bees attempt to copulate with bee orchid
  - largest plant family (before humans began to cut down tropical
    rainforests)
    - pollinators move, but orchids do not
  - orchids hybridize incredibly easily
    - thus orchid developers are constantly trying to develop new and
      interesting flowers

- outcrossing mechanisms
  - some species routinely self-fertilize (guarantees some seed production)
  - mechanisms to promote outcrossing:
    - structural flap that receives pollen on the way in

- carpel - modified leaf
  - ovules are inside the ovary portion of the carpel
  - believed to have developed from a gymnosperm leaf that closed in on itself
  - megasporangia
    - inside each ovule is a single ovule which contains a megasporocyte
    - each megasporocyte produces four megaspores
    - female gametophyte - embryo sac
      - one cell contains two nuclei

- double-fertilization
  - functional double-fertilization is unique to the angiosperms
  - found in one small possibly ancestral group of gymnosperms

- endosperm function:
  - stores nutrients and carbohydrates
  - endosperm is NOT part of the embryo
    - endosperm is part of the seed
    - embryo is embedded in the endosperm
  - sometimes stored reserves are transferred to the developing embryo
  - sometimes the germinating seedling absorbes the stored reserves directly
    from the endosperm
