meiosis - in animals, occurs prior to production of eggs and sperm
meiosis - this type of nuclear division divides heriditary material in half
mitosis - nuclear division responsible for growth
mitosis - addition of somatic cells
fertilization - restores the normal amount of hereditary material
gametes - eggs and sperm
mitosis - a division of the genetic material in the nucleus that produces
daughter cells genetically identical to the parent cell
mitosis - usually accompanied by cytokinesis
mitosis - the basis of asexual reproduction
mitosis - involved in the production of somatic (body) cells
mitosis - can occur in eukaryotic organisms when they multiply without sexual
reproduction (e.g. yeast)
mitosis - occurs when the body repairs a wound
chromosomes - contain a long double helix of DNA wrapped around proteins
mitosis - its purpose is to distribute genetic material in chromosomes to
daughter cells during cell division
chromosomes - looks like paired "threads"
chromosomes - their movement is the means by which cells get their genetic
material into daughter cells
unreplicated chromosome - consists of a single, long strand of DNA wrapped
around proteins
replicated chromosome - produced when chromosome is copied
DNA - condenses around its associated proteins, resulting in a compact
chromosome that is 10,000 times shorter than its original length
cell cycle - the orderly sequence of events that occurs starting from the
formation of a eukaryotic cell through the duplication of its chromosomes to
the time it undergoes cell division
condensed - genetic material is only visible in cells when it is this
phases - parts of the cell cycle
division phase - part of the cell cycle when it is dividing
interphase - part of the cell cycle when it is not dividing
G1 phase - originally appeared to be a gap in the cell activity
24 hours - length of time it takes a human cell to complete one cell cycle
S phase - DNA synthesis phase
gap phases - ensure there is plenty of material/organelles available for cell
division to occur
G1 phase - when chromosomes are unreplicated
S phase and G2 - when there are replicated chromosomes present
sister chromatids - another name for a pair of duplicate chromosomes
replicated chromosomes - condense at the start of mitosis
interphase - after chromosome replication, each chromosome is composed of two
sister chromatids
mitosis - prior to this, centrosomes have replicated
microtubules - large, hollow tubes made of tubulin dimers
microtubles - originate from the centrosome and grow outword
centrioles - two bundles of microtubules which compose the centrosome in
animals
mitosis - when sister chromatids separate and one chromosome copy goes to each
daughter nucleus
early mitotic spindle - form from the centriole during prophase
prophase - chromsomes condense and mitotic spindle begins to form
spindle fibers - fibers extending from the centrosomes
prometaphase - nuclear envelope breaks down and spindle fibers contact
chromosomes at kinetochore
kinetochore - where spindle fibers contact chromosomes in prometaphase
metaphase - chromosomes complete migration to the middle of the cell
anaphase - sister chromatids separate and chromosomes are pulled to opposite
poles of the cell
telophase - the nuclear envelope re-forms and the spindle apparatus
disintegrates
cytokinesis - when the cytoplasm is divided
cell division - part of mitosis when the actin-myosin ring causes the plasma
membrane to begin pinching in
cleavage furrow - row of actin filaments which tighten via motor proteins
cell plate - produced in the process of rebuilding the cell wall in plants
G1 phase - essentially eliminated in rapidly dividing cells
nondividing cells - get permanently stuck in G1 phase
G0 state - arrested stage in which nondividing cells get permanently stuck in
G1 phase
oocyte - *TODO*
mitosis-promoting factor - induces mitosis in all eukaryotes
MPF - composed of a cyclin and a protein kinase
cyclin - in MPF, functions as a regulatory protein
kinase - in MPF, catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate gropu from ATP to a
target protein
cyclin - its conceptration regulates MPF concentration
MPF - activated by dephosphorylzation of MPF Cdk
cdk - has constant concentration throughout mitosis
cyclin - increases linearly throughout mitosis and then drops off
activated MPF - cyclin + cdk with dephosphorylated, cyclin-dependent kinase
subunit
# activated MPF - causes:
# 1. phosphorylate chromosomal proteins; initiate M phase
# 2. phosphorylate nuclear lamins; initiate nuclear envelope breakdown
# 3. phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins; possibly activate mitotic spindle
# 4. phosphorylate an enzyme that degrades cyclin; cyclin concentrations decline
G2 checkpoint - passed if chromosome replication is successfully completed,
there is no DNA damage, and activated MPF is present
metaphase checkpoint - passed if all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic
spindle
G1 checkpoint - passed if there are sufficient nutrients, growth factors
(signals from other cells) are present, cell size is adequate, and DNA is
undamaged
cancer - a complex family of diseases caused by cells that grow in an
uncontrolled fashion, that invade nearby tissues, and that spread to other
sites in the body

exact copy of parent - result of mitosis
mitosis - type of nuclear division that results in an exact copy of the parent
G2 - stage of cell cycle in which most of the organelles are made
brain cells - generally stop growing and dividing once mature
G1 checkpoint - subject to social control
G1 checkpoint - cancers are thought to arise from cells with defects in this
social control - describes mechanism by which whole organism controls cell
cycle
meiosis - nuclear division that precedes the formation of gametes and results
in halving of chromosome number
gametes - egg and sperm
meiosis - results in 4 daughter cells not identical to the parent
alleles - different versions of a specific gene
chromosomes - carry sections of DNA that influence one or more hereditary
traits
gene - a section of DNA that influences one or more hereditary traits
homologous chromosomes - chromosomes of the same type
homologs - chromosomes of the same type
haploids - organisms that have one of each type of chromosome
diploids - organisms that have two of each type of chromosome
polyplods - organisms that have more than one of each type of chromosome
haploid number - indicates the number of distinct types of chromosomes present
in an organism's cells
ploidy - indicates the number of each type of chromosomes present in a cell
zygote - the cell that results from fertilization
diploids - indicates the number of each type of chromosome in zygotes
fertilization - when two haploid gametes fuse
fertilization - restores the full complement of chromosomes after meiosis
# TODO: fell asleep here
prophase I - in this phase of meiosis, tetrads form by the senapse of homologs
and crossing over occurs
crossing over - *TODO*
metaphase I - in this phase of meiosis, homologs align at the metaphase plate
anaphase I and telophase I - in these phases of meiosis, diploid homologs
separate and two haploid cells result
meiosis II - in this phase of meiosis, sister chromatids separate
sister chromatids - *TODO*
sister chromatids - held together by proteins that span the entire link, plus
at the centromere
synaptonemal complexes - bind two pair of chromosomes together
protein complexes - bind together non-sister chromatids
# consequences of meiosis - independent shuffling of maternal and paternal
chromosomes and crossing over during meiosis I result in four gametes whose
composition is different from that of the parent cells
sexual reproduction - results in offspring with unique characteristics through
separation of homologous chromosomes, crossing over, and fertilization
meiosis I - during this phase, tetrads can line up two different ways before
the homologs separate
tetrads - can line up two different ways before the homologs separate in
meiosis I
crossing over - produces novel combinations of alleles on the same chromosome
corsisng over - increases genetic variability in gametes
crossing over - through this, even self-fertilization leads to genetically
variable offspring
gametes - produced by meiosis II
metaphase - during this phase of meiosis, chromosomes can line up in many
different ways
asexual reproduction - evolutionary reason given for existence of meiosis
asexual reproduction - can produce 16 offspring in just 2 generations
sexual reproduction - produces 4 offspring in 2 generations
purifying selection hypothesis - in asexual reproduction, a damaged gene will
be inherited by all of that individual's offspring.  over time, natural
selection against deleterious alleles will nullify the numerical advantage of
asexual reproduction
changing environment hypothesis - offspring that are genetically different
from their parents may be more likely to survive and produce offspring if the
environment changes
purifying selection hypothesis - explains sexual reproduction in that
undesirable/harmful genes can be filtered out, whereas over time, these genes
may multiply in asexual reproduction
changing environment hypothesis - explains sexual reproduction in that it
allows hosts to develop changes to combat viral infections
