photosynthesis - process of using light to produce energy (check this
definition)
photosynthesis - before this process began on earth, it is believed there was
no oxygen in the earth's atmosphere
# early researchers thought that CO2 + H2O --> CH2O + O2
# (30's/40's) - photosynthesis in purple sulfur bacteria:
#   CO2 + 2H2S + light --> (CH2O)n + H2O + 2S
# => shows that CO2 and H2O do not combine directly do form CH2O AND the
# oxygen atoms in CO2 are not released as O2
photosynthesis - two linked sets of reactions: a light-dependent reaction that
produces O2 from H2O and a second light-independent reaction of the Calvin
cycle that produces sugar from CO2
electrons - link the two sets of reactions in photosynthesis
chloroplasts - where all photosynthetic reactions occur
surface area - the structure of a chloroplast has lots of this
pigments - molecules that absorb light
photosynthetic pigments - molecules that use absorbed light to drive the light
reactions of photosynthesis
chlorophyll - the most abundant pigment in the thylakoid membranes of plants
electromagnetic spectrum - range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation
photosynthetically active radiation - wavelengths of light used by plants
cartenoids - absorb blue and green light and transmit yellow, orange or red
light
chlorophylls - absorb blue and red light and transmit green light
chlorophyll - dominant pigment in plants due to its short wavelengths / high
energy
accessory pigments - absorb light and pass the energy to chlorophyll
accessory pigments - allow the plants to absorb light from a wider range in
the spectrum
lutein - a pigment produced very strongly by spinach, kale, and other leafy
greans
chlorophyll - the first pigment to degrade when leaves die
head - part of the chlorophyll where light is absorbed
lipid tail - part of the chlorophyll that anchors the molecule in the
thylakoid membrane
ring - describes the structure of the chlorophyll head
photosystem - group of 200+ chlorophyll molecules working together
photosystem - consists of an antenna complex and a reaction center
antenna complex - where energy is transmitted from one chlorophyll molecule to
its neighbor until the energy reaches the reaction center
reaction center - once the energy reaches this place, excited electrons are
transferred to an electron acceptor
redox - this type of reaction occurs at the reaction center in a photosystem
reaction center - there are two types of this: photosystem I and photosystem
II
enhancement effect - produced when two photosystem sowrk together (TODO:
