exergonic - indicates that a raection releases energy
endergonic - indications that a reaction requires an input of energy
phosphorylation - addition of a phosphate group to a substrate
glucose - the most common fuel used by organisms
metabolism - all the chemical reactions that occur in living cells
energetic coupling - coupling between an exergonic and endergonic reaction
redox reactions - class of chemical reactions that involve the loss or gain of
one or more elections
oxidations - loss of electrons
reduction - gain of electrons
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide - NAD+
NAD+ - reduced to form NADH
NADH - formed from the reduction of NAD+
electron carrier - readily donates electrons to other molecules
glucose - does not burn in cells but is oxidized through a long series of
carfully controlled redox reactions
glucose - its oxidation is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and P_i
cellular respiration - a four-step process for producing ATP from a starting
material with a high potential energy
glycosis - first step of cellular respiration
glycosis - when one molecule of glucose is broken into two molecules of the
three-carbon compound pyuravate
glycosis - 2 ATP + NAD+ --> ADP + NADH
pyruvate processing - second step of cellular respiration
pyruvate processing - when pyruvate is processed to form acetyl-CoA
citric acid cycle - third step in cellular respiration
citric acid cycle - when ATP and NADH are produced and flavine adenine
dinucleotide (FAD) is reduced to form FADH_2
electron transport and chemiosmosis - fourth step of cellular respiration
electron transport and chemiosmosis - when electrons from NADH and FADH_2 move
through a series of proteins called an electron transport chain
electron transport chain - when electrons from NADH and FADH_2 move through
this series of proteins, potential energy is released which is used to create
a protein gradient across a protein; the ensuiing flow of protons back across
the membrane is used to make ATP
cellular repiration - any suite of reactions that produces ATP in an electron
transport chain
glycosis - processing glycose to pyruvate
glycosis - sequence of 10 reactions which occur in the cytosol
substrate-level phosphorylation - enzyme-catalyzed reactions that result in
ATP production
phosphofructokinase - catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-1,6-biphosphate from
fructose-6-phosphate
feedback inhibition - when an enzyme in a pathway is inhibited by the product
of the reaction sequence
regulatory site - a location that changes the activity of an enzyme
phosphofructokinase - regulatory site where ATP binds when concentrations are high
ATP - acts as an allosteric regulator
cristae - sac-like structures which fill the mitochodria
mitochondrial matrix - region of the mitochondria inside the inner membrane
but outside the cristae
acetyle CoA - produced when pyruvate reacts with CoA
coenzyme A - CoA
CoA - acts as an enzyme by accepting and then transfering an acetyl group to a
substrate
pyruvate dehydrogenase - enzyme complex where acetyl CoA is produced
carboxylic acides - acids with the form R-COOH
guanosine triphosphate - this and ATP are produced through substrate-level
phosphorylation
high - reaction rates are this when ATP is scarce
low - reaction rates are this when ATP is abundant
TCA cycle - starts with acetyl and ends with CO2
TCA cycle - its reactions occur in the mitochondrial matrix, and the potential
energy that is released is used to produce NADH, FADH_2, and ATP or GTP
electron transport chain - collectively, the molecules responsible for the
oxidation of NADH and FADH_2
ATP synthase - enzyme which makes part of the protein spin, driving production
of ATP from ADP and P_i
oxidative phosphorylation - mode of ATP production which links the
phosphorylation of ADP with the oxidation of NADH and FADH_2
ubinquinone - non-protein found in the inner membrane of the mitochonddria
ubinquinone - quinone which is nearly ubiquitous in organisms
coenzyme Q - another name for ubinquinone
proton-motive force - enzyme in the inner membrane of the mitochonddria uses
this to synthesize ATP
chemiosmosis - production of ATP via a proton gradient
electron transport chain - its job is to pump protons from the matrix of the
mitochondria through the inner membrane and out to the inner membrane space or
the interior of cristae
chemiosmosis - like a hydroelectric dam, where the movement of water makes
turbines spin and generate electricity
electron transport chain - analgous to a series of gigantic pumps that force
water up and behind the dam
cotochrome c - acts as a shuttle which transfers electron between complexes
ATP synthase - enzyme that both hydrolyzes and synthesizes ATP
lactic acid fermentation - forms a product molecule called lactate and
regenerates NAD+
fermentation - a metabolic pathway that regenerates NAD+ from stockpiles of
NADH
fermentation - allows glycosis to continue producing ATP in the absense of the
electron acceptor required by the ETC
NAD+ - produced when NADH gets rid of electrons
glycosis - produces ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation when NAD+ is
present
fermentation - widespread type of metabolism which is inefficient compared
with aerobic cellular respiration
fermentation - in organisms that usually use oxygen as an electron acceptor,
and alternative mode of energy production when oxygen supplies temporarily run
out
faculative aerobes - electron acceptor in oraganisms that can switch between
fermentationh and cellular respiration
catabolic pathways - reactions that break down molecules and produce ATP
anabolic pathways - reactions that syntehsize larger molecules from smaller
components
glycerol - enters the glycotic pathway once it has been oxidized and
phosphorylated to form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
