=== Soil ===

- parent paterial - substrate from which soil forms
  - may be bedrock or some deposited material (sediments, organic material)
  - determines soil texture, mineral content
  - influences soil structure and pH
- rocks
  - sedimentary
  - igneous
  - metamorphic
- clay
  - protons displace cations on the surface of the clay
  - importance of texture
  - clay texture holds onto more water
- parent materials are weathered by other soil forming factors to form soil
  - horizons: O, A (topsoil), B (subsoil), C (parent material)
- climate
  - primarily temperature and precipitation patterns
  - temperature controls freeze-thaw cycles that contribute to physical
    weathering
  - temperature also affects the rate of biochemical reactions
  - temperature also affects the rate of decomposition by fungi, bacteria, and
    other living organisms
  - precipitation contributes to soil moisture, which affects plant growth and
    the activity of decomposing organisms
  - precipitation affects erosion (the physical loss of soil particles) and
    leaching (chemical losses from the soil solution as water pases through
    the soil -- this contributes to profile formation)
  - major biomes are determined by climate
    - but _named_ by plant communities
  - microclimate also important in soil development
- living organisms
  - macro-organisms
  - plants
    - contribute organic material - both above (shoots) and below (roots), and
      both sources affect horizonation
    - help to mix the soil -- root channels, wind throws
    - cycle nutrients from soil to plant and back (sometimes through animals,
      always through decomposers)
    - help prevent soil erosion by breaking the force of rain (dissipated when
      it hits the leaves instead of the soil), providing a litter layer
    - some parent material will develop into a different soil under different
      plant communities
  - animals
    - help to mix the soil by burrowing
    - contribute oraganic material when they die
