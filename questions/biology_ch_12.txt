heterozygous - *TODO*
genotype - *TODO*
phenotype - *TODO*
gamete - *TODO*
testcross - tool used by Mendel in which homozygous recessive parent is mated
with a parent with dominant phenotype and unknown genotype
testcross - tool used by Mendel to infer genotype of parent with dominant
phenotype and unknown genotype
chromosome theory of inheritance - explains Mendel's principle of segregation
by independent alignment and separation of homologous chromosomes containing
alleles for a gene at meiosis I
principle of segregation - for genes located on the same chromosome, each
gamete carries only one allele, because alleles have segregated during meiosis
principle of independent assortment - genes located on different chromosomes
assort independently
karotype - *TODO*
x-linked inheritance - *TODO*
reciprocal cross - *TODO*
