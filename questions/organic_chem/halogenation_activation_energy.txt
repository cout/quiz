high activation energy - chain-initiating step in fluorination
low activation energy - chain-propogating step in fluorination
higher activation energy than fluorination - first chain-propogation step in
chlorination
higher activation energy than chlorination - first chain-propogation step in
bromination
activation energy high enough to make reaction unfeasible - first chain-propogation step in iodination
