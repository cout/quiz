- Critical thinking: can you think of a real0life example of an adaptive
  phenotype???
  - A: everything!
  - remember: natural selection is not random

- Preservation of natural variation
  - diploidy - 2 alleles for every gene
    - recessive alleles retained in heterozygotes
      - not expressed
      - not eliminated, even if the recessive trait is eliminated
      - aa may be eliminated, while Aa is preserved in the population
    - recessive alleles function as latent variation that may prove helpful if
      environment changes
  - balanced polymorphism - promotes heterozyogous individuals
    - heterozygous advantage
    - frequency-dependent selection
      - a predator might not focus in on the polymorphic trait - if the
        predator is present, it is finding its prey item based on
        characteristics that aren't necessarily polymorphic
        - e.g. color variation on a snail
          - color form that is _most common_ is also most likely to be _eaten_
          - when the less common variation becomes the most common variation,
            the predator will adapt, resulting in a rebound effect
    - phenotypic variation
    - example: single base-supstitution in the gene that codes for hemoglobin;
      single base change causes the hemoglobin to crystalize and form a
      rod-shape instead of typical shape
      - heterozygous dominant not adaptive (sickle-cell enemia)
      - homozygous dominant not adaptive (no resistance to malaria)
      - extra credit: why is the heterozyogous gene resistant to malaria
  - neutral variation
    - genetic variation that has no apparent effect on fitness
    - not affected by natural selection

- Key contepts:
  - the modern synthesis
  - populations and the gene pool
  - hardy-weignberg equilibrium
  - micro-evolution
  - sources of genetic variation
  - natural selection
  - preservation of genetic variation

==== Lecture #3 - origin of species ====

- Key concepts
  - different ways we define species
    - basic definition: to be reproductively isolated from other species
  - common patterns of speciation
  - macroevolution - gradual accumulation of changes or major changes?
  - human evolution 

- pet peeve: _species_ is both singular and plural

- _community_ vs _population_ vs _ecosystem_

- major species concepts
  - biological
    - standard way that we have to separate species
      - if two individuals can produce _successful_ offspring, then they are
        the same species
      - if they cannot, then theyt are not
    - species are defined by _natural reproductive isolation_
    - two cases where this doesn't work:
      - certain kinds of fungi cannot be classified because of inability to
        observe reproductin
      - divergence of species is a slow process with fuzzy boundaries during
        divergence; can be difficult to use reproductive isolation to classify
        species
      - can't use this definition to classify _extinct_ species, because we
        can't observe reproduction
  - morphological - the first way to separate species (Linnaeus, ~1750 &
    others)
    - species are defined by differences in form - individuals with the same
      morphology and/or anatomy are considered the same species
    - Linnaeus "had it right" in most cases - his classification is still used
      today
    - problemes:
      - some species have a lot of natural phenotypic variation
    - advantages:
      - the only way to classify extinct species and species that lack sexual
        reproduction
      - important in describing _new_ species
  - phylogenetic species
    - relatively new, becoming "new standard" for separating species
    - species are defined by evolutionary history
      - species = "smallest monophyletic group" ("monophyletic tip") in an evolutionary tree
      - monophyletic = lineage is derived from a common ancestor
    - problems:
      - we don't have good phylogenies for all species or groups
      - not perfect agreement/interpretation of data

- pre-zygotic barriers
  - if zygotes cannot form, then evolution stops
