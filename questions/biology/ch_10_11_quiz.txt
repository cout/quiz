photophosphorylation - results when ADP is phosphorylated by energy released
when protons move from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma
photorespiration - an energy-demanding process that reduces the efficiency of
photosynthesis
mitotic spindle - attaches to chromosomes in prophase
mitotic spindle - nuclear envelope must disintegrate in order for this to
attach to kinetochores
G1 checkpoint - requires social controls from other cells to continue
cancer cells - often grow unregulated due to a defect in social controls
cancer cells - can often be cultered in the absence of externally supplied
growth factors because the social controls of the G1 checkpoint are defective
haploid cells - first appear after completion of meiosis I
meiosis I - after this is when haploid cells first appear
nondisjunction error - when chromosomes fail to line up properly in meiosis I
tetrads - line up in the middle of the cell in meiosis I
