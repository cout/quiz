alpha effect - when lone pairs exist on neighboring atoms
electronegativity - measures the affinity of an atom for electrons
induction - "pulling" of electron density
ARIO - Atom Resonance Induction Orbital (four factors for stabilizing charges)
conformations - different positions that a molecule can twist into
configuration - right-handedness (R) or left-handedness (S)
stereocenters - regions that can be R or S
stereoisomers - compounds that differ in configuration
enantiomers - compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images
racemic - equal mixture of both enantiomers
diastereomers - compounds that are nonsuperimposable stereoisomers that are
not mirror images of each other
meso compund - has a stereocenter and is a mirror image of itself
nucleophile - a compound that uses its electrons to attack another compound
electrophile - a compound that is attacked by a nucleophile
nucleophilicity - measures how quickly a reagent will attack another compound
basicity - measures base strength by position of equilibrium
radical - an intermeidate possessing one or more unpaired electrons
homolytic bond dissociation energy - energy required to break bonds
homolytically
energy - must be supplied to break covalent bonds
homolytic bond dissociation energy - 𝘋𝘏°
enthalphy change - 𝛥𝘏°
