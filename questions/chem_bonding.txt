nonpolar bond - atoms share valence electrons equally
polar bond - atoms share valence electrons unequally
lattice structures - opposite-charged ions bounded to each other
bond order - half the number of electrons shared in a covalent bond
bond polarity - occurs in bonds between atoms of unqueal electronegativities
fluorine - most electronegative element
oxygen - second-most electronegative element
covalent bond - a bond that is formed when two elements share valence
electrons
electronegativity - ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons
bond strength - the energy required to break a chemical bond
valence electrons - electrons in the outermost occupied electron shell
octet rule - an atom is most stable when its valence shell is completely full
ionic bond - bond formed when the electronegativities of bonded atoms are
significantly different
