- essential fatty acids
  - phospholipid membranes
  - energy storage
  - cushioning and insulation
  - steroids and some hormones
- vitamins
  - organic molecules typically used in small quantities
  - coenzymes or enzyme cofactors
  - some are fat soluble instead of water soluble
- minerals
  - calcium - bones, nerve and muscle fibers
  - phosphorus - phospholipid bilayer, bones, ATP
  - sulfur - some proteins
  - potassium, chlorine, sodium - nerve function
  - magnesium - enzyme cofactor
  - iron - hemoglobin, eÂ¯ carrier, enzyme cofactor

- food processing
  - ingestion
  - digestion
  - absorption
  - elimination

EC: is there some other food that pandas can eat as a substitute for bamboo?

- evolution of compartmentalization
  - food digestion must be contained
  - sponges do this by containing digestion structures in vacuoles (completely
    inside the cell)
  - most animals digest at least partly outside the cell
    - simplest/earliest which do this are jellyfish and flatworms ("one hole
      sac body plan")
      - single opening for incoming food and outgoing waste (inefficient)
      - partly digest their food in the gastrovascular (?) cavity and then (?)
    - bilateral symmetry ("two hole tube plan")
      - food processed sequentially (no mixing of incoming food and outgoing
        waste)
      - allows for _specialization_ along the digestive tract
        - both _divergent_ and _convergent_ patterns have emerged
          - all mammals have a cecum
            - vestigial in some mammals
          - both earthworms and birds have developed crops
            - crop - soft, stretchy chamber that allows the storage of food
            - gizzard - musclar organ w/ bony protuberances; muscular motion
              working w/ grit can work seed coat off


- human digestive system
  - relatively straightforward apdaptations to an omnivorous diet
  - tube running from mouth to anus w/ specialized regions for
    - food processing
    - absorption
    - elimination of waste
  - oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus allows for chewing and swalling food
    - teeth cut and grind
    - tongue mixes and pushes _bolus_ to back
    - saliva
      - lubricates food
      - protects the mouth lining
      - buffers pH
      - kills bacteria
      - begins digestion
    - epiglottis - tips down to direct food from pharynx to esophagus
    - peristaltic contractions in esophagus push food to stomach
    - sphincter (ring) muscles also control passage of food
  - somach
    - stores food (very folded and stretchy)
    - muscle contractions _mix_ food
    - lining secretes gastric guice
      - HCl
        - dissolves cell matrices 
        - denatures proteins in swallowed food
        - also kills many ingested bacteria
      - pepsin - begins protein hydrolysis
        - produced as a precursor of pepsinogen
          - pepsinogen produced in the lumen of the cells
      - stomach lining protected from self-digestion by thick mucus and
        secretion of inactive pepsin precursor
