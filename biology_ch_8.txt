plasma membrane

mature and stop gorwing

integrins - transmembrane proteins connected to actin filaments
fibronectins - nerby proteins in the ECM to which integrins bind
fibronectins - proteins in the ECM which connect to collagen fibers
cytoskeleton-ECM linkage - keeps individual cells in place and helps adjacent
cells adhere to each other
cytoskeleton-ECM linkage - when this breaks down, cancer can develop
metastasis - process by which tumor breaks away and migrates throughout the
body, forming new tumors
connections between cells - basis of multicellularity
tissues - groups of similar cells that perform a similar function
tissues - something most multicellular organisms have
middle lamella - central layer between primary cell walls of adjacent plant
cells
middle lamella - continuous with the primary cell walls of adjacent cells in
plants
middle lamella - serves to glue together adjacent cells in plants
gelatinous polysaccharides - material which composes middle-lamella-like layer
in adjacent animal cells
cytoskelton-ECM connections - help hold individual animal cells together
epithelia - tissues that form external and internal surfaces
epithelia - form layers that separate organs and other structures
epithelia - must be sealed to prevent mixing of solutions from adjacent organs
or structures
tight junction - cell-cell attachment composed of specialized proteins in the
plasma membranes of adjacent animal cells
tight junction - proteins in this type of cell-cell attachment line up and
bind to one another
tight junction - its structure resembles quilting, with the proteins acting as
stitches
tight junction - type of cell-cell attachment that forms a watertight seal
tight junction - commonly found in cells that form a barrier, such as the
epithelial cells lining the stomach and intestines
tight junction - prevents ions and molecules in the gut contents from leaking
cells and diffusing into the body
tight junction - may loosen to permit more transport between epithelial cells
desmosomes - cell-cell attachment particularly common in animal epithelial
cells and certain muscle cells
desmosomes - cell-cell attachment whose structure is analgous to rivets that
hold pieces of sheet metal together
desmosomes - cell-cell attachment that contains proteins that bind to each
other and to larger proteins that anchor filaments in the cytoskeleton of
adjacent cells
desmosomes - bind together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells
selective adhesion - phenomenon in which cells of differing types combine and
aggregate because they adhere to cells of the same tissue type
antibody - protein that binds specifically to a section of another protein
antibody - can be used to block certain portions of proteins or mark proteins
so they can be seen
cadherins - attachment molecules in desmosomes
cell adhesion proteins - allow animal cells to attach to each other in a
selective manner by binding and riveting certain cells together
plasmodesmata - direct connections in plants between the cytoplasm of adjacent
cells
smooth endoplasmic reticulum - runs through plasmodesmata
plasmodesmata - contain proteins that regulate the passage of specific
proteins between plant cells, making the connections in similar function to
the nuclear pore complex
gap junction - connects adjacent cells in most animal tissues
gap junction - features a specialized protein that creates channels between
animal cells
gap junction - allows water, ions, and small molecules such as amino acids,
sugars, and nucleoties to move between adjacent cells
hormones - information-carrying molecules that are secreted from a plant or
animal cell, circulate in the body, and act on target cells far from the
original cell that sent the signal
cell-cell signal - coordinates activities of cells in different parts of a
multicellular body
cell-cell signal - important whether it is lipid solublle, because the signal
has to be recognized to have an effect on a target cell
lipid-soluble signals - diffuse across the plasma membrane
hydrophilic cell-cell signals - are lipid-insoluble and do not cross the
plasma membrane
hydrophilic cell-cell signals - must be recognized at the cell surface
receptor - its presence dictates which cells will respond to a particular
hormone
beta-blockers - bind to certain receptors for adrenaline
signal receptor - protein that changes its shape and activity after binding to
a signaling molecule
lipid-soluble signals - processed directly when it enters a cell without any
intermediate steps
siginal transduction - triggered when a signal binds at the cell surface
signal amplification - allows hormones present in miniscule concentrations to
trigger a large response from cells
signal transduction - converts an extracellular signal to an intracellular
signal
signal transduction - signal processing step that begins at the plasma membrane
signal amplification - signal processing step that occurs inside the cell
G proteins - peripheral membrane proteins closely associated with signal
receptors
G proteins - when activated by a signal receptor, these trigger messenger
