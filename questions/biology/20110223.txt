- life cycle
  - in the plant kingdom, meiosis _always_ produces spores
    - only occurs once in the life cyle
  - gametes are produced by _mitosis_
  - with angiosperms, meiosis occurs in two different places (microspore,
    megaspore)
  - advantages to retaining the female gametophyte in the sporophyte:
    - nutrients/resources
    - protection (seed)
  - life cycle takes place in the flower in angiosperms:
    - pine trees do not have flowers/fruit (they have cones)
  - parts of a flower:
    - sepals
      - typically green and protect the flower/bud
      - below petals
    - petals
      - typically colored and larger than the sepals
      - the "sterile" part of the flower
    - stamens
      - anther (microsporangium)
      - filament - strand that supports the anther
    - carpels - innermost part of the flower
      - stigma - usually adapted to hang on to pollen
      - style - connects the stigma to the ovary
      - ovary
        - swollen basal portion of the carpel
        - contains _at least_ one ovule (some contain hundreds or thousands,
          e.g. orchids)

- classes of angiosperms:
  - paleoherbs
  - magnoliids
  - eudicots - 70% of all angiosperms (broadleaf trees, shrubs,
    fruit/vegetable crops)
  - monocots - grasses, sedges, iris, orchids

- monocots
  - flower parts in multiples of 3
  - parallel leaf venation
  - single cotyledon
  - vascular bundles in complex arrangements
  - 90K varieties
  - sepals almost always alternate with petals

- dicots
  - flower parts -
  - leaf venation -
  - cotyledon -
  - vascular bundles -
  - varieties -

- in angiosperms, pollen never directly contacts the egg cell (it does
  however in the gymnosperms)

- corn husk is the _style_
