- Macroevolution: larger-scale changes in organisms
  - Also contributes to speciation
  - small, population-scale changes can accumulate:
    - can have small-scale changes that 
  - exaptations - traits that emerged in response to one selective pressure
    become beneficial in another way
    - birds gained feathers because they made them warmer, but then they were
      also useful for flying
  - large phenotypic changes can result from small changes in regulatory
    genes (i.e. genes that turn traits on/off)

- somatic mutations (occur in body tissues, e.g. cancers) - are not passed on,
  because they are not in the gamete

- critical thinking: was the evolution of the modern horse a series of
  directed events?
  - directed = only one possible path

- preview of the taxonomic hierarchy
  - (covered again in 211)
  - all organisms can be classified in this way
  - humans are:
    - _chordates_ (in the chordate phylum)
    - vertebrate sub-phylum
    - mammal class
    - primate order
    - one of several families: hominids

- two key things happened in the evolutions of humans/primates:
  - bi-pedalism
    - 
  - large brain

- Extra credit question: what do we know about humans from > 30K regarding
  use of language?

- Fossil record - shows changes in our species over time
  - rituals, etc.
  - path of human evolution is not ladder-like
  - we can see dead ends in the fossil record
  - we are cirrently mono-____ (all but one lineage of hominids are extinct)
     - evidence of mating between humans and neanderthals?

- evidence that humans migrated out of afica into the rest of the world
  - multiregional hypothesis vs. "out of africa" hypothesis

- extra credit: why does inbreeding cause unfavorable traits in humans (but
  not in other animals)?
  - answer (scratch the extra credit): recessive alleles

- evolution is a constant process on this planet
  - we have a constant supply of random variation
    - shuffling of alleles
    - genetic mutation
  - constant supply of selection pressure
    - vary over time
    - vary over habitats
  - result:
    - constant divergence of population
    - constatnt extinction

- Key concepts:
  - species
  - development of reproductive isolation
  - patterns of speciation
  - macroevolution
  - human evolution
  - evolution continues
