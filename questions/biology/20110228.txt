- Embryonic Development
  - Two unequally-sized cells
    - Terminal cell - develops into the embryo
    - Basal cell - develops into the suspensor (anchor, plunger and nutrient
      conduit)
      - anchors the embryo into the seed
      - forms chain-like structure that pushes the 

- chromosome number in the different parts of the seed
  - seed coat - 2n
  - endosperm - 3n
  - embryo - 2n

- Parts of the embryo:
  - radical --> root
    - emerges first, anchoring the plant into the soil
    - seeks out sources of nutrients
  - hypocotyl and epicotyl --> stem
    - epicotyl - often referred to as a "seed leaf" (?)
  - cotyledon --> nutrients for seedling
  - plummule --> first true leaves

- Fruits - mature ovary + any accessory structures
  - pericarp (ovary wall)
    - typically the bulk of the fruit
    - can be dry or fleshy
  - dry fruits typically disperse by gravity, wind currents, or explosions
    - some are carried by animals via sharp or barbed hairs
  - fleshy fruits are typicall eaten by some animal, with the seeds "planted"
    in fecal droppings
    - most are indehiscent - get split open by animal when eaten

- EC: find out if "beauty berry" is edible
  - callicarpa americana

- EC: bird of paradise flower
  - single flower or a ____ of flower?
  - also check out "grains of pardise" - are they related?

- EC: can seahorses reproduce asexually?

- asexual reproduction
  - pros and cons?
    - rapid colonization of space
    - good genotypes spread
    - less "expensive" than sexual reproduction
    - clones are always susceptible - insects, pathogens, changing
      conditions...
