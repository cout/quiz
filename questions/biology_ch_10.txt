photosynthesis - process of using light to produce energy (check this
definition)
photosynthesis - before this process began on earth, it is believed there was
no oxygen in the earth's atmosphere
# early researchers thought that CO2 + H2O --> CH2O + O2
# (30's/40's) - photosynthesis in purple sulfur bacteria:
#   CO2 + 2H2S + light --> (CH2O)n + H2O + 2S
# => shows that CO2 and H2O do not combine directly do form CH2O AND the
# oxygen atoms in CO2 are not released as O2
photosynthesis - two linked sets of reactions: a light-dependent reaction that
produces O2 from H2O and a second light-independent reaction of the Calvin
cycle that produces sugar from CO2
electrons - link the two sets of reactions in photosynthesis
chloroplasts - where all photosynthetic reactions occur
surface area - the structure of a chloroplast has lots of this
pigments - molecules that absorb light
photosynthetic pigments - molecules that use absorbed light to drive the light
reactions of photosynthesis
chlorophyll - the most abundant pigment in the thylakoid membranes of plants
electromagnetic spectrum - range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation
photosynthetically active radiation - wavelengths of light used by plants
cartenoids - absorb blue and green light and transmit yellow, orange or red
light
chlorophylls - absorb blue and red light and transmit green light
chlorophyll - dominant pigment in plants due to its short wavelengths / high
energy
accessory pigments - absorb light and pass the energy to chlorophyll
accessory pigments - allow the plants to absorb light from a wider range in
the spectrum
lutein - a pigment produced very strongly by spinach, kale, and other leafy
greans
chlorophyll - the first pigment to degrade when leaves die
head - part of the chlorophyll where light is absorbed
lipid tail - part of the chlorophyll that anchors the molecule in the
thylakoid membrane
ring - describes the structure of the chlorophyll head
photosystem - group of 200+ chlorophyll molecules working together
photosystem - consists of an antenna complex and a reaction center
antenna complex - where energy is transmitted from one chlorophyll molecule to
its neighbor until the energy reaches the reaction center
reaction center - once the energy reaches this place, excited electrons are
transferred to an electron acceptor
redox - this type of reaction occurs at the reaction center in a photosystem
reaction center - there are two types of this: photosystem I and photosystem
II
enhancement effect - produced when two photosystem sowrk together (*TODO*:

# TODO: missed 20 minutes of notes here
z scheme - photosystems I and II working together
ATP - produced via proton-motive force in electron transport chain
plastoquinone - carries protons to the inside of thylakoids, creating a
proton-motive force
proton-motive force - created by carrying protons to the inside of thylakoids
plastoquinone - passes electron to cytochrome complex
photosystem II - generates ATP and molecular oxygen
phyotosystem I - energy used to reduce 2NADP+ to 2NADPH
calvin cycle - carbion dioxide reduced to glycose
ATP and NADPH - used to produce sugar from CO2 in dark reactions
dark reactions - producing sugar from CO2
light reactions - produce ATP and NADPH
CO2 - in calvin cycle, fixted to ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) to form 3-phosphoglycerate
ATP and NADPH - in calvin cycle, convert 3-phosphoglycerate to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)
RuBP - in calvin cycle, regenerated from G3P
G3P - in calvin cycle, used to regenerate RuBP
3 - number of turns of calvin cycle to produce one G3P
3 - number of carbons in G3P sugar
rubisco - most abundant enzyme on earth
rubisco - rubulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
rubisco - enzyme which catalyzes the addition of CO2
rubisco - enzyme found in every organism which utilizes the calvin cycle
rubisco - non-specific enzyme which can catalyze the addition of O2 to RuBP
O2 - competes with CO2 for rubisco enzyme
CO2 - competes with O2 for rubisco enzyme
photorespiration - occurs when O2 and RuBP are combined
photorespiration - a reverse photosynthesis which uses up ATP and produces CO2
photorespiration - when this occurs, rate of photosynthesis declines
drastically
carbon fixation - favored over photorespiration when a cell's CO2
concentration is high and O2 concentration is low
photorespiration - plants need to "find ways" to keep CO2 concentration high
to avoid this
cuticle - waxy lipid substance which cover plants
cuticle - believed to help make transition possible for plants to live on land
from living in water
stomata - leaf structures where gas exchange occurs
guard cells - two of these in stomata change shape to open or close
stomata - open to allow atmosphereic CO2 to diffuse into the leaf and
ultimately along a concentration gradient into its cells chloroplasts
stomata - open when a leaf's CO2 concentration is low
CO2 - diffuses into leaves through stomata
C3 plants - RuBP + CO2 ---rubisco---> two 3-phosphoglycerate (3-carbon sugar)
C4 plants - 3-carbon compound + CO2 ---PEP carboxylase---> 4-carbon organic
acids
PEP carboxylase - takes a 3-carbon compound and adds a CO2 to produce a
4-carbon organic acid in C4 plants
C4 pathway - a carbon pump
C4 cycle - interacts with the calvin cycle
bundle-sheath cells - surround the vascular tissue in C4 plants
meophyll cells - where C4 cycle occurs
bundle-sheath cells - where calvin cycle occurs
bundle-sheath cells - where product of C4 cycle goes
vascular tissue - where product of calvin cycle goes in C4 plants
C4 pathway - common in plants that live in hot dry environments
PEP carboxylase - enzyme which not catalyze the addition of CO2 (and thus
still functions properly when stomata are closed)
C4 pathway - minimizes photorespiration by ensuring a steady supply of CO2 to
phtosynthesizing cells
CAM - crassulacean acid metabolism
crassulacea - genus name for a group of plants that are desert-type plants
crassulacea - plants which live an a dry environment where opening stomata can
be fatal as water would be lost
CAM mesophyll cell - separate processes spatially instead of temporarally
