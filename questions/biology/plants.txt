- Key concepts:
  - what is a kingdom?
  - why study plants
  - what makes a plant a plant
  - hierarchy of structure:
    - cells
    - tissues
    - organs
  - growth
    - plants grow in a way that is very different from how animals grow
    - all plants can expand their roots
    - some plants can expand their _diameter_
  - ____genesis

- Carolus Linnaeus
  - gave us the system of modern taxonomy
  - prior, we had no good way to name/classify organisms
    - Linaeus gave us an _efficient_ way to name organisms (genus+species)
      - e.g. plantanthere ciliaris - ciliaris could apply to _any_ genus
  - Linaeus' taxonomic hierarchy:
    - kingdom, division (phylum), class, order, family, genus, specific
      name/epithet

- Kingdoms
  - Linnaeus recognized only two kingdoms:
    - animals - move
    - plants - do not move
      - fungi considered plants
    - microscopic world largely unknown (microscopes were not efficient enough
      to recognize single-cell organisms)
  - 5-kingdom system
    - developed in the 1960's and used until recently
  - molecular data supports 3-domain classification scheme:
    - bacteria
    - archaea
    - eukarya
    - new _level_ added to classification system - the _domain_
  - viruses not classified this way, not considered to be living organisms
    - ask classmate about extra credit about viruses

- classification is dynamic
  - as we get more information, we reorganize our classification scheme
  - classification is not the goal; organization of the information that we
    have is the goal

- _chemosynthetic_ bacteria - live off the energy/minerals that spew out of
  deep-sea vents

- Plant growth
  - monocots
    - do not have wood (palm "trees" do not produce wood - parenchyma tissue)
    - leaves:
      - epidermis
      - cortex-palisde mesophyll
    - stomata - pores to allow for gas exchange and transpiration

  - plants _adjust to_ their environment (as they cannot leave or take
    advantage of changes in their environment)

  - meristem tissues
    - actively dividing cells that enerate other cells in the plant body
    - cause indeterminate groth
      - stems and roots are enlongating throughout time
      - trees continually expand diamter
      - branches form in roots and stems

  - some plans do have a genetically predetermined lifespan
    - annuals, perinnials
    - trees will grow until some environmental factor knocks them out
      - some trees are very susceptible to rot - these will tend to die sooner

  - plant growth patterns
    - indeterminate - roots and stems
      - primary growth
      - allows the plant to explore, take advantage of new resources
    - determinate - leaves, flowers, fruit

  - every plant cell carries the whole genetic code for the organism
    - some mature cells can de-differentiate to become meristemic again
    - some cells _cannot_ differntiate
      - once the cells is _lignified_ it can no longer expand or divide

  - plant cells can divide in multiple planes
    - determines the number of dimensions in which the tissue develops
    - 1D - files - vascular tissue
    - 2D - sheets - epiderminal tissue
    - 3D - bulky - ground tissue

  - auxin-mediated cell expansion (hormone)
    - auxin attaches to cell membrane and stimulates proton pump which moves
      protons from cytoplasm into cell wall
    - loosens cell wall, nearly guarantees that the cell will absorb water and
      expand

  - direction of cell expansion depends on cellulose orientation and
    contributes to morphogenesis
    - wrapping of cellulose around the cell is not a random process; it is
      under genetic control
    - direction which wrapping occurs determines which direction the cell is
      capable of expanding

  - expansion and differentiation occur in an overlapping zone in al plants
    - zone of maturation
    - zone of elongation
    - zone of cell division (apical and primary meristems)

  - review - growth:
    - an irriversable increase in size
    - very different in plants than in animals
    - ...

- location of the meristems determines the pattern of plant growth
  - most common meristems:
    - apical - buds
    - axillary - roots
    - lateral - cylinders that run up and down the entire circumference of the
      plant

  - root cap
    - protects the meristem
    - determines geotropism
      - able to sense gravity and grow _down_
    - secretes mucigel (gelatinous material)
      - eases movement of roots through soil
      - secretes chemicals that enhance nutrient uptake
      - soil chemical environment is _altered_ by the roots
    - constantly shedding cells
      - mechanical abrasion as roots grow through soil
    - constantly being replinished by meristem

  - root hairs
    - forms as the epidermis fuly differentiates
    - extensions off epidermal cells
      - not files/chains of cells
      - part of an epidermal cell
    - hugely increase the surface area of the epidermis
    - almost invisible to the naked eye
    - increase surface area for the absorption of water/nutrients

  - more than 80% of all plant species form a symbiotic relationship with
    _fungi_ which enables them to expand their surface area even more than
    with root hairs alone

  - apical meristem - no "shoot cap"
    - no friction through the air

  - primary growth
    - apical meristem
    - leaf primordia
    - axillary buds

  - primary growth in shoots - elongation
    - elongation from the tip (plants grow from the _tip_, not the _base_)

  - secondary growth - diameter expansion
    - does not occur in all plants (primarily in woody plants, significant
      mainly in _trees_)
    - occurs because a laterial meristem (cylindrical) "connects the dots"
      between the vscular bundles
    - makes the xylem and phloem as time goes by
    - roots also expand in diameter but this is different and more complex
    - laterial meristem = cambium
    - produces wood: causes wood to accumulate on the interior of the tree
    - cannot occur in monocots
    - vascular cambium forms in the space between the xylem and phloem
      - from that point on, the cylinder which is formed is what is producing
        the xylem and phloem
    - secondary xylem accumulates in cylinders
      - tissues (particularly xylem) will remain present, but "squished into
        oblivion"
      - sexoncary xylem == wood
    - impossible to say with any certainty whether a particular stem has
      switched over from primary to secondary growth
      - most trees elongate within the first few weeks of the growing season
        and the enter secondary growth
    - cambium - "straw" made out of single layer of cells (simplification)
      - divides to the inside to make xylem
      - to the outside to make phloem
      - in one plane to expand in diameter, in another plane to expand in
        length
      - only one layer of vascular cambium
        - tree does not make new vascular cambium each year; one cylinder of
          vascular cambium gets larger over time

  - key difference between primary/secondary growth
    - primary growth - elongation; form in blundles from apical meristem
    - secondary growth - cylinder forms, and from that point on once vascular
      meristem is formed, tree is engaged in secondary growth

  - my comment: live indefinitely != live forever

  - rays go across the tree - complicated

  - bark
    - all tissues external to / outside of the vascular cambium
      - everything from the vascular cambium to the outside of the tree is
        considered bark
    - diameter expansion splits original epidermis
      - epidermis is "eroded away" as tree expands
      - bark structurally and functionally replaces epidermis
    - inner bark
      - living/functional secondary phloem
    - outer bark
      - composition varies as tree matures
    - cork cambium
      - meristematic tissue
      - forms during secondary growth as a cylinder
      - divides (in both directions) to produce cork cells
        - new cells get filled with suberin (waxy, waterproof/hydrophobic)
          material
        - cells die and become "cork"
      - eventually cork cambium itself gets filled with suberin and becomes
        cork
      - development
        - first layer forms from cortex - de-differentiation
        - second layer forms from cortex - same process
        - this layer forms from cortex...
        - cortex eventually runs out (plant does not make more cortex)
        - once cortex runs out, secondary phloem begins to get used to form
          fork
          - result: accumulation of xylem, but no accumulation of secondary
            phloem
          - depth of the bark varies, but it is never as big as the xylem
    - almost all trees can be identified by their _bark alone_

  - very little living tissue in a tree -> easy to strangle a tree

  - step derivations and fates (diagram from book):
    - apical meristem
      |-> protoderm (primary meristem)
      |  +-> epidermis (primary tissue)
      |
      |-> procambium (primary meristem)
      |  |-> primary phloem (primary tissue)
      |  |-> primary xylem (primary tissue)
      |  |
      |  +-> vascular cambium (lateral meristem)
      |     |-> secondary xylem (secondary tissue)
      |     +-> secondary phloem (secondary tissue)
      |
      +-> ground meristem (primary meristem)
         +-> ground tissue / pith cortex (primary tissue)
            +-> cork camium (laterial meristem)
               +-> cork (also produced from secondary phloem)

- Plant Transport
  - Key concepts:
    - importance of water
    - water potential - phi = P - s
    - how water moves
      - gradients
      - mechamisms
      - pathways
    - transpiration - water movement from soil to plant to atmosphere
    - the pressure flow model of phloem transport

  - why water?
    - required for metabolism and cytoplasm
    - nutrients are taken up and transported in water-based solution
    - metabolic products are transported in water-based solution
    - water movement through the plant affects gas exchange and leaf
      transpiration

  - water potential (phi)
    - controls the movement of water
    - a measure of _potential entergy_
    - wter always moves from an area of high potential to an area of low
      potential
    - controled by phtsical pressure, ...
    - measured in megaPascals
      - can be negative (tension)
