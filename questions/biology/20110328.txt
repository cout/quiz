- circulation systems have evolved over time
  - most primitive animals exchange gases and circulate resources by diffusion
  - only remaining animals that do this are the sponges and jellies
  - sponges have no muscle tissue; only flagella
  - jellies have contractile fibers but not muscles
  - flatworms are truly bilaterally symmetrical; they do develop muscles
  - most invertebrates have an open circulatory system
    - heart pumps fluid (helolymph) through blood vessels into the body cavity
    - fluid is sucked back into the heart as it contracts
    - vessels are not connected to each other
    - hemolymph is returned to vessels via ostia pores
    - requires less metabolic energy than a closed system
  - closed circulatory systems
    - separate blood from interstitial fluid
    - completely separate blood from hemolymph
    - most large animals that use a large of energy have a closed circulatory
      system (insects remain small b/c of open circulatory system and
      exoskeleton)
    - only place where blood and interstitial fluid is in the capillary beds
    - can supply more oxygen more rapidly
    - all closed circulatory systems have a chambered heart
      - atria - take blood in from the body
      - ventricles - pump blood out
      - one-way valves direct blood flow
      - recommendation: sketch this out, but as a schematic rather than a
        photorealistic image
    - vessels contain the blood
      - veins carry blood to atria
      - artieries carry blood from ventricles
      - pulmonary artery is low oxygen (i.e. it is not the oxygen content
        which determines whether it is an artery or vein)
    - capillary beds facilitate exchange
      - capillary beds separate arteries from veins
      - highly branched and very tiny
      - completely infiltrate all parts / every tissue in the body
      - this is the only place where resource exchange happens (zero resource
        exchange in the arteries and veins)
    - not all animals have a 4-chambered heart
      - fish - 2-chambered heart (one atrium, one ventricle)
        - single pump of the heart has to pump through 2 capillary beds in a
          single circuit
        - blood pressure drops as blood enters the capillaries
        - blood flow is very slow
    - all other animals have a two-circuit system:
      - two circuits in creases the efficiency of gas exchange (double
        circulation)
      - one circuit goes to the exchange surface
      - one circuit goes to body systems
      - both circuits under high pressure (increases flow rate)
      - amphibians have a 3-chambered heart
        - two atria, one ventricle
        - ventricle pumps to 2 circuits
          - one to lungs and skin to release CO2 and acquire O2
          - other circuit circulates through body tissue
        - oxygen rich and oxyghen poor blood mix in the ventricle (a ridge
          helps to direct flow)
      - most reptiles also have a 3-chambered heart
        - increasation sepatation rel. to amphibians
        - partial septum further separates blood flow and decreases mixing (up
          to 3 partial lower chambers)
        - crocodiles have a 4-chambered heart
      - mammals and birds have 4-chambered hearts
        - endothemeric, so need more metabolic energy to support their heat
          generation
        - mammals and birds are not monophyletic (they do not share a common
          ancestral lineage)
          - split was probably from a fairly reptilian ancestor (amniote -
            terrestrial, producing adapted eggs)
          - convergent evolution of the 4-chambered heart

- blood circulation
  - blood vessels are organs
    - outer layer is elastic connective tissue that changes diameter as blood
      move under pressure
    - middle layer is smooth muscle and elastic fibers
    - inner layer is endothelial tissue
  - arteries have thicker walls
  - capillars have only an endothelium and basement membrane
  - small pressure drop as arteries branch
  - blood pressure drops significantly as it moves through the capillary beds
    - cross sectional area increases dramatically b/c of increase in the
      number of vessels
  - velocity drops as pressure drops
  - velocity drops to near 0 at capillary beds but goes back up as muscle
    contractions help to push blood back to the heart
    - fluid can accumulate in appendages

- capillary exchange
  - gas exchange and other transfers occur in the capillary beds
  - muscle contractions determine which beds are "open" (one-way valve
    controls flow)
    - brain, heart, kidkeys, and liver are generaally fluuy open
    - digestive system capillaries open avter a meal
    - skeletal muscle capillaries open during exercising

EC: is there a vacuum effect in the atria?
  - as as the ventricles pump does it suck blood into the atria
