# - How does the simple primary and secondary structure of DNA hold the
#   information required to make life possible? (ch 15)
# - How is DNA copied so that genetic information is faithfully passed from
#   one cell to another during growth and from parents to offspring during
#   reproduction?
deoxyribonucleotide - phosphate group, OH on 3' carbon, base
DNA base - adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine
primary structure of DNA - phosphodiester linkages between phosphate groups,
nitrogenous bases form backbone
nitrogenous bases - form H-bonds to each other
complementary base pairs - joined by hydrogen bonding
sugar-phosphate - "backbone" of DNA
semiconservative replication - each old DNA strand is copied to generate a new
strand; each new chromosome is composed of one strand of old DNA and one
strand of newly synthesized DNA
conservative replication - original chromosome is copied but remains
unchanged; one chromosome is composed of old strands and the other of new
strands
dispersive replication - replication process generates two new chromosomes,
with new and old sections of DNA mixed together randomly
# experiment:
# - e-coli grown in broth of N¹⁵
# - transfer to medium containing N¹⁴
# - sample each generation to find out where "light" nitrogen ends up
# - after generation 2:
#   - semiconservative: hybrid, ¹⁴N, hybrid, ¹⁴N
#   - conservative: ¹⁵N, ¹⁴N, ¹⁴N, ¹⁴N
#   - dispersive: hybrid, hybrid, hybrid, hybrid
# - conclusion: semiconservative replication is how it happens
replication bubble - *TODO*
replication fork - Y-shaped region where the DNA is split into two separate
strands for copying
helicase - opens double helix
single-strand DNA-binding proteins (SSBP) - stabilize single strands to keep
them apart during replication
topoisomerase - relieves twisting forces on unsplit DNA to keep it from
keeting bound up
polymerase II - catalyzes reaction *TODO*
primase - synthesizes an RNA primer so that polymerase has a 3' end to work
with; is removed later
RNA primer - synthesizes a little bit of RNA; gives polymerase III something
to work with
template DNA - where DNA nucleotides will be inserted
sliding clamp - holds DNA polymerase in place
DNA polymease III - works in 5' -> 3' direction, synthesizing leading strand
lagging strand - synthesized discontinuously in the direction away from the
replication fork (and thus lags beind the fork)
DNA synthesis - must proceed in the 5' -> 3' direction
okazaki fragments - short discontinuous fragments used to synthesize lagging
strand
topoisomerase - *TODO*
# synthesis of lagging strand:
# 1. ?
# 2. DNA polymerase III works in 5' -> 3' direction, synthesizing first
# okazaki frament of lagging strand
# 3. primase and DNA polymerase III synthesize another okazaki fragment
DNA polymerase I - removes the RNA primer at the beginning of each okazaki
fragment and fills the gap
# 4. DNA polymerase I removes ribonucleotides of primer, replaes then with
# deoxyribonucleotides in 5' -> 3' direction
# 5. dna ligase - closes gap in sugar-phosphate backbone
DNA ligase - closes gap in sugar-phosphate backbone
DNA ligase - joins the okazaki fragments to form a continuous DNA strand
circular - shape of bacterial chromosomes
linear - shape of eukaryotic chromosomes
bacterial chromosomes - continue replication in both directions around the
circle until a complete copy is made
telomeres - regions at the end of linear chromosomes
# as the replication fork reaches the end of a linear chromosome, there is no
# way to replace the RNA primer from the lagging strand with DNA, because
# there is no available primer for DNA synthesis
# chromosome shortening during normal dna replicatoin:
# 3. DNA polymerase synthesizes last okazaki fragment in lagging strand
# 4. no DNA synthesis occurs after primer is removed (no free 3' end for DNA
# polymerase); chromosome is shortened
telomeres - contain short repetitive sequences of "nonsense" DNA
telomeres - replicated by telomerase
telomerase - catalyzes the synthesis of DNA from an RNA template (by base
pairing) and carries its own RNA template
telomerase - adds more repeating bases to the end of the lagging strand,
catalyzing the synthesis of DNA from an RNA template that it carries with it
# 1. when the RNA primer is removed from the 5' end of the lagging strand, a
# strand of parent DNA remains unreplicated
# 2. telomerase binds to the "overhanging" section of single-stranded DNA;
# telomerase adds deoxyribonucleotides to the end of the parent DNA, extending
# it
# 3. telomerase moves down the DNA strand and adds additional repeats
# 4. primase, DNA polymerase, and ligase then synthesisze the lagging strand
# in the 5' -> 3' direction, restoring the original length of the chromosome
telomerase - only active within cells of reproductive organs (those that
divide by meiosis / producing gametes)
chromosomes of somatic cells - gradually shorten with each cell division
shortening of telomeres - influences the cell cycle (G0 phase)
non-dividing cells - get permanently stuck in G1 (G0 phase)
< 1 mistake per million bases - DNA replication error rate in terms of
mismatched bases
DNA polymerase III - can repair mismatches
< 1 mistake per ten billion bases - DNA replication error rate taking repaired
mismatches into account
UV light - can cause thymine dimers to form, causing a kink in the DNA strand
nucleotide excision repair - system by which cells fix damaged DNA
thymine dimer - created when two adjacant thymines bond to each other, instead
of to the proper base on the other strand
xeroderma pigmentosum - rare autorecessive defect that causes humans to be
exceptionally sensitive to UV light
