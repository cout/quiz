- Hardy-Weinberg theorem
  - Meiosis and fertilization randomly shuffle alleles, but they don't change
    proportions

- Conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
  - no natural selection, large population size, isolated population, random
    mating, no mutation
  - does NOT occur in nature

- So what is the value of H-W?
  - gives us a no-change point of view (null hypothesis) to help explain
    what does happen in nature

- Limitations of H-W theorem:
  - considers only one gene at a time, assuming one-to-one correlation
    between genes/traits
    - reality is much more complex

- _Populations_ are what evolve, not individuals
  - individuals _vary_, but populations _evolve_
  - "The environment is the wall; natural selection is the gate"
    - only individuals that are adapted to the environment "pass through the
      wall"

- micro-evolution
  - natural selection
    - "differential reproductive success" is the cornerstone of darwin's
      success and the only way to account for:
      - accumulation of favorable traits
      - "weeding out" of unfavorable traits

  - genetic drift - random changes in allele frequency from generation to
    generation
    - if < 100% of the population reproduces (almost always true), then there is
      not an appropriate representation of the population in the sample
    - bottleneck effect
      - when only a small pct of individuals reproduce
      - caused when some event causes only a small percentage of the population
        to survive
      - bottleneck -> mass extinction -> diversification follows
      - examples of bottlenecked species: cheetahs
        - most cheetahs killed after last ice age
        - genetic code for kinked tail passed to most cheetahs
        - species being bottlenecked again post-industrialization
    - founder effect
      - occurs when a single individual (or small group of individuals) breaks
        off from a larger population to colonize a new habitat
        - single individual could be a pregnant female
      - long-distance dispersal events can lead to the founder effect (e.g.
        seeds stuck to a very mobile animal)
      - _adaptive radiation_ - frequently leads to many new, closely related
        species (as the organisms adapt to new habitat zones in their new home)

  - gene flow - reverse of genetic drift
    - alleles being moved into and out of a population
    - most populations are not completely isolated
    - will tend to preserve species by shuffling alleles between all
      sub-population (thus tends to _reduce_ speciation)

  - selective mating
    - H-W assumes completely random mating - does not happen in nature
    - proximity is important [even] in species that do not have mating
      behaviors
      - mating is therefore more probable among individuals with greater
        proximity

  - mutations
    - mechanisms exist to "fix" errors
    - nevertheless, mutations can and do occur
    - with mutations we get completely new trates

  - summary: evoulations = random events * "the gate"
    - mutations/variations are random
    - selection is not random

- meiosis - key source of variation
  - independent assortment - random, independent events
  - recombination - increases potential variation
  - only _mutations_ can produce _completely new_ traits (_meiosis_ cannot)

- natural selection makes a population more "fit"
  - fitness = likelihood of reproductive success
  - selection acts on the phenotype
    - and the phenotype is a complex result
    - each generation has the genotype of the previous generation behind it
      - (unless there is a major mutation with every generation)
