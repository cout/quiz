- Bulk flow in capillary beds
  - Remember: phi = P - s

- "one-circuit" diagram not completely accurate for fish
  - two sets of gills, therefore two arteries
  - but the blood must still flow through the gills without getting pumped a
    second time by the heart
  - double arch is the ancestral condition for the vertebrate circulatory
    system
  - later vertebrates lost one of those arches (we kept the left arch and lost
    the right arch)
  - birds lost the left arch and kept the right arch

- Capillary transport process
  - endocytosis -> exocytosis across membrane
  - diffusion based on concentration gradients
  - bulk flow between endothelial cells
    - water potential gradient forces solution out at arterial end
    - redution in pressure draws most (85%) fluid back in at venous end
    - remaining fluid is absorbed into lymph, returned at shoulder ducts
