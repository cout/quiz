allele - different versions of the same gene
karotype - number and type of chromosomes present
autosomes - non-sex chromosomes
ploidy - combination of the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell
polyploid - species with three or more of each type of chromosome in each cell
centromere - where sister chromatids are physically joined
replicated chromosome - consists of two linear structures joined at the
centromere
gametogenesis - gamete-origin
gametogenesis - process of forming egg or sperm cells
metaphase plate - region in the middle of the cell where kinetochore
microtubules move the pair of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I
crossing over - process of chromosome exchange between paternal and maternal
segments
chiasma - X-shaped structure formed in early crossover
tetrad - structure that results from synapsis
synapsis - process of homologous chromosome pairs coming together
cytokinesis - division of cytoplasm
synaptonemal complex - network of proteins which hold together two-pairs of
non-sister chromatids during prophase I
genetic recombination - any change in the combination of alleles on a given
chromosome
outcrossing - alternative to self-fertilization in sexually reproducing
species in which gametes form different individuals to form offspring
trisomy - presence of an extra chromosome
nondisjunction - when homologs fail to separate or disjoin
monosomy - zygote with only one chromosome (which is too few)
aneuploid - cells that have too many or too few chromosomes
