knock-out mutant - *TODO*
gene - a particular stretch of dna
messenger RNA - transcribed from DNA
transcription - DNA -> mRNA
protein - translated from mRNA *TODO*
translation - mRNA -> protein *TODO*
# Q: tRNA?
one-gene, one-enzyme hypothesis - proposes that genes contain the information
needed to make proteins, many of which function as enzymes
# how did researchers figure out that genes code for proteins?
# information encoded in the bas sequence of DNA cannot by directly translated
# into the amino acid sequence of proteins because DNA and ribosomes (which
# make proteins) are physically separated
Crick - proposed the model in which mRNA is the middleman
nucleus - where DNA is found
cytoplasm - where protein is synthesized
RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA according to the information provided by DNA
# experiment: role of mRNA in transcribing DNA so that its information can be
# carried to the cytoplasm
central dogma of molecular biology - DNA -> RNA -> proteins
sequence of bases in a particular stretch of DNA - specifies the sequence of
bases in an RNA molecule, which specifies the sequence of amino acids in a
protein
DNA - information storage molecule
mRNA - information carrier molecule
proteins - active cell machinery
transcription - nucleic acid to nucleic acid
translation - nucleic acid to amino acid
codon - word in the genetic code
# George Gamow - proposed that each codon contains three bases (there are 20
# amino acids: if a codon consisted of only 2 bases, there are only 16
# possible combinations)
# Q: this suggests that there are 12 more possible amino acids
# A: there is some /redundancy/ in this code
# genetic code is unambiguous, as one codon never codes for more than one
# amino acid
