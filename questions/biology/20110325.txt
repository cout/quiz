- Cows - extra compartments house symbiotic microorganisms
  - food is often _regurgitated_ and/or _reconsumed_
  - regugitation comes from the _rumen_

- diet is a selection pressure
  - some anumals store partially digested food in their caecum

- Review: Key concepts
  - animals are heterotrophic
  - nutritional needs
    - energy
    - carbon skeletons
    - essential nutrients
  - food processing
  - the human digestive system
  - diet as a selection pressure

EC: is there a bird that can consume a walnut and crack it in the gizzard?
  - turkeys?
  - is the gizzard actually strong enough to do this?
  - does this actually occur?
  - was the book talking about english walnuts?

== Lecture #10 - circulation and gas exchange systems ==

- exam will cover though as far as the other section gets on Tuesday

- Key concepts:
  - circulation and gas exchange - why?
  - circulation - spanning diversity
  - hearts - the evolution of double circulation
  - blood circulation and capillary exchange
    - exchange surface is the capillary bed
  - blood structure and function
  - gas exchange - spanning diversity
  - breathing - spanning diversity
  - respiratory pigments

- _almost_ all animals are aerobic
  - last year researchers found small animals in the mediterranean that are
    anaerobic
     - biomedcentral.com/...
  - circulation systems move gases and other essential resources throughout
    the animal's body
  - respiratory systems exchange gasses with the environment
  - muscle tissue can survive temporarily in an anaerobic environment (this
    happens during exercizing; result is glycolysis and product is lactic
    acid)

- circulation systems have evolved over time
  - the most primitive animals exchange gasses and circulate resources
    sentirely by diffusion
  - process is slow and cannot support large 3D structures
    - small surface area / volume ratio
    - plants have small amounts of living tissue; parts of the plants that are
      alive (leaves and roots) have large amounts of surface area
