zaitsev product - more stable alkene
hofmann product - less stable alkene
axial - leaving atoms on a cyclohexane must be this
equatorial - atoms on a cyclohexane that are this will not be in the same
plane
equatorial - atoms on a cyclohexane that are this will not eliminate by E2
SN2 - stereochemistry is inverted
elimiation - use heat for (general term)
substitution - use cold for (general term)
SN1/E1 - solvolysis
3° - slowest alkyl by SN2
1° - fastest alkyl by SN2
# TODO: I need to figure this out
# E2 - strong base
# E2 - 1° substrate with strong, hindered base
# SN2 - 1° substrate without strong, hindered base
check nucleophile - 2° substrate
SN2 - 2° substrate, strong nucleophile
SN1 - 2° substrate, weak nucleophile
check leaving group - 2° substrate, moderate nucleophile
SN1 - 2° substrate, moderate nucleophile, excellent leaving group
no reaction - 2° substrate, moderate nucleophile, bad leaving group
check solvent - 2° substrate, moderate nucleophile, good leaving group
either SN1 or SN2 - protic solvent
SN2 - aprotic solvent
