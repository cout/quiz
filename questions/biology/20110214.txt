- Pressure Flow Model for Phloem Transport
  - high solute at source end decreases phi
  - water moves into the source end of the phloem
  - increases the pressure
  - increased pressure at source end causes phloem sap to move to any area of
    lower phi = sinks
  - sugar/sap: _source_ (leaf cell) -> companion cell -> phloem / sieve-tube
    elements -> companion cell -> SINK (root cell)
  - water: flows up through xylem, back and forth from phloem to/from xylem
    - from xylem to phloem to build pressure
    - back to xylem as a result of gradient
  - at sink end sugars removed by metabolism, by conversion to starch or by
    active transport
  - phloem sap constantly moving from source to sink
  - water almost never flows backwards in the xylem
  - fairly recently developed model (1970s?)

=== Lecture #6 - plant nutrition and soils ===
- resource requirements for plant growth
  - solar energy, CO₂, O₂, water, mineral nutrients
- plant tissue composition by weight
  - most living organisms are mostly water - plants are no exception
  - fresh herbaeous tissue is 80-805% water
  - little water is incorporated into plant tissue
    - water suplies all the H to carbohydrates; electrons and protons for
      photosynthesis
    - most water is in the cell solution, in the vacuoles, or passing through
      in the transpiration stream
- macromolecules
  - cellulose
  - pectin
  - lignin
  -
  -
- essential elements for metabolic processes
  - chloroophyll
  - nucleic acids
  - ATP
  - enzymes
  - enzyme cofactors - many _micronutrients_
  - elemenets that control water, charge, and solute balances - K, Cl, P, Ca,
    others
- macro nutrients vs micro nutrients
  - macro: nitroge, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur
  - micro: chloroine, iron, boron, manganese, zinc, copper, and molybdenum
    - some plants also require nickel, sodium, silicon, selenium, or others
  - see study table in book
    - KNOW all macronutrients
    - be able to DISTINGUISH all micronutrients
