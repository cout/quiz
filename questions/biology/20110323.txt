- Ulcers
  - Risk factors: bacteria, tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, aspirin, chocolate

- Small intestine
  - where most digestion occurs
  - absorption of monomers
  - folding - increases surface area
  - most digestion occurs in the first 25cm
    - pancreas secretes enzymes and bicarbonate
    - liver secretes bile (helps digest fat)
  - most absorption occurs in the latter 5.75m
    - high concentration of monomers in the fluid in the intestinal tract
    - many pathways to move monomers cross eipthelium into interstitial fluid
      and then into capillary bed
    - some transport is facilitated; some is active
  - fat digestion
    - bile salts _emulsify_ large fat droplets into smaller droplets
      (increases surface area)
    - lipase digestion produces fatty acids and monoglycerides
    - these monomers form into micelles
    - transported out of cells by exocytosis

- large intestine / colon
  - small intestine connected to large intestine and cecum at a tee
    - appendix extends off cecum
    - cecum functions as fermentation chamber in many animals, especially
      herbivores
    - human cecum is very small
  - main function is to absorb water
  - houses both commensal and mutualistic bacteria

EC: Is the gall bladder derived from the liver?
  - is it common for the gall bladder to regenerate?

EC: what adaptation causes fats to go into the lymph notes instead of the
blood?
  - lymph system is directly connected to the circulatory system
  - when there is too much pressure, the lymph flows into the blood vessels
    (and this can happen in the reverse direction as well)

EC: if methane is odorless, then why do freshwater marshes have such a
distinctive smell?

EC: how did dentition jaw structure / muscular arrangement emerge and change
over evolutionary time in different lineages / based on different diets

Q: pKa vs pH

Recommendation:
  - upper-level evolution course
  - departmental seminars
