=== Soil ===

- Living organisms
  - micro-organisms
    - decompose organic material, cycle nutrients, add organic material
    - trillions/kg of soil (double handful of soil...)
    - n-fixing bacteria - supply virtually all N for plant growth, either free
      living or in nodule
      - nitrogen paradox
        - bacteria convert atmospheric N to forms suitable for plant uptake
        - bacteria feed plant nitrogen
        - plant feeds bacteria carbohydrates
        - Q: why is this a paradox?
        - (lightning also provides a source of nitrogen)
    - miycorrhizae - mutual symbiotic association between fungi and and roots
      - present in most plants (80-90% of all plant species)
      - _required_ in some plants (e.g. orchids)
      - dramatically increases surface area of roots

- Human impact

- Topography - shape of the land
  - determines the movement of water, thus affecting erosion and leaching
    rates
  - determines where water accumulates, which affects soil moisture, which
    affacts organismal activity, which affects soils...
  - aspect affects the amount of solar radiation at the surface, and thus soil
    temperature
  - large topographic features influence precipitaiton patterns
  - event micro-topography affects plant distribution
  - hills - shade the north/east sides (northern hemisphere)
  - orographic lifting - causes cooling and precipitation, rain shadow to the
    leeward side
    - leeward - opposite of windward?

- Time

=== More on nutrients ===

- rhizosphere
  - zone where nutrience are acumulated by the plant
  - plant affects soil through compounds secreted by the plant's roots
  - relative proportions of nutrience in the soil solution can affect uptake
    of all nutrience
  - different species have different nutrient requirements
  - control zone for plant/soil interaction
  - big volume of soil, narrow zone around each root

- some plants use alternate methods to absorb some nutrients
  - parasites
  - saprophytes
  - carnivores

- important: what to organisms use nitrogen and phosphorous for
  - phospho-lipid membrane!

=== Lecture #7 - angiosperm reproduction ===

- Key concepts:
  - life cycles- alternation of generations
  - structure of a flower
  - development of the male gametophte
  - pollination in all its glories
  - development fothe female gametophyte
  - fertilization
  - empryos, seeds and fruit
  - asexual reproduction

- life cycle:
  - haploid gametophyte -> [ mitosis ] -> [ fertilization ] -> [ mitosis ] -> diploid
    sporophyte -> [ meiosis ] -> spores or mitosis; [ mitosis ] -> haploid gametophyte
  - all modern plants alternate between multicellular 1n and 2n generations
  - our focus is on the most derived group of plants - the angiosperms
  - evolution of reproductive strategies in the other divisions will be
    covered in 211
 
- angiosperms - the flowering plants
  - by far the most important phylum of pants in the modern flora
  - ~90% of all extant plant species
  - dominate _most_ ecosystems (even gymnosperm-dominated ecosystems have a
    significant angiosperm population)
  - primary ecological importance - base of terrestrial food chain + many
    other ecosystem resources
  - primary economic importance - food, building materials, parmaceuticals,
    horticulture, floriculture

- angiosperms produce 2 different kinds of spores (thus two places in the
  plant where meiosis takes place):
  - microsphore -> male gemetophyte (pollen, released to the air) -> sperm
  - megaspore -> female gametophyte (retained in sporangia) -> egg
