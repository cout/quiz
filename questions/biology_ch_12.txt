heterozygous - *TODO*
genotype - *TODO*
phenotype - *TODO*
gamete - *TODO*
testcross - tool used by Mendel in which homozygous recessive parent is mated
with a parent with dominant phenotype and unknown genotype
testcross - tool used by Mendel to infer genotype of parent with dominant
phenotype and unknown genotype
chromosome theory of inheritance - explains Mendel's principle of segregation
by independent alignment and separation of homologous chromosomes containing
alleles for a gene at meiosis I
principle of segregation - for genes located on the same chromosome, each
gamete carries only one allele, because alleles have segregated during meiosis
principle of independent assortment - genes located on different chromosomes
assort independently
karotype - *TODO*
x-linked inheritance - *TODO*
reciprocal cross - *TODO*

drosophila melanogaster - eye color of this organism can be easily followed in
different generations
sex-linked chromosome - eye color in drosophila melanogaster is an example
karyotyping - determining how many individual chromosomes an individual
organism has and how many copies it has
# X any Y chromosomes are *different sizes*, so they cannot possibly carry the
# same genes
# However, the line up just like the other chromosomes as if they did contain
# the same genes
sex-linked inheritance - occurs when the gene being inherited is located on
one of the sex chromosomes
#    |  w    y
# ---|-----------
# w+ | w+w  w+y
# w  | ww   wy
autosomes - non-sex chromosomes
autosomal inheritance - results from genes on autosomes
autosomes - do not configmed to Mendel's rules
reciprocal crosses - these crosses often give different results from Mendel's
rules
linked genes - inherited together unless crossing over occurs
recombinant chromosomes - recombinant combinations of alleles
greater physical distance - increases the chance that crossing over will occur
linear arraay - genes on a chromosome are arranged this way
physical distance - dictates the frequency of crossing over between genes
location - can be mapped by analyzing a gene's frequency of recombination
frequency of recombination - calculated as frequency of recombinant genotype /
total # offspring)
genetic map - diagram that shows the relative locations of specific genes on a
certain chromosome
centiMorgans - unit of distance between two genes on a genetic map
centiMorgans - one map unit on a genetic map represents one of these
centiMorgans - represents the physical distance that produces 1%... *TODO*
independent assortment - occurs for genes more than 50 or more map units apart
on the same chromosome
multiple allelism - when a gene has more than two alleles
polymorphic - a trait in which more than two distinct phenotypes are present
in a population due to multiple allelism
incomplete dominance - when heterozygotes have an intermediate phenotype
incomplete dominance and codominance - when alleles of a gene are not clearly
dominant or recessive
codominance - a trait displayed in a heterozygous organism that displays the
phenotype of both alleles of a single gene
pleitropic - a gene that influences multiple traits
Marfan syntrome - a good example in humans of a pleiotropic gene
epistasis - when one gene affects the action of another gene
blanks - when writing a genotype, mean that either allele can be present
discrete - traits that are qualitatively different and no intermediate
phenotypes exist
quantitative - traits that fall into a continuum
polygenic inheritance - each gene adds a small amount to the value of a
phenotype
